God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.[1:9] And God said, 'Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so.[1:10] God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good."
